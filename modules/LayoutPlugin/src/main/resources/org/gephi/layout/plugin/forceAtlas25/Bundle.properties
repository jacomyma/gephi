ForceAtlas25.name=ForceAtlas 2.5
ForceAtlas25.description=Quality layout: a linear-attraction linear-repulsion model with few approximations (BarnesHut). Speed automatically computed.

ForceAtlas25.tuning=Tuning
ForceAtlas25.behavior=Behavior Alternatives
ForceAtlas25.performance=Performance
ForceAtlas25.threads=Threads

ForceAtlas25.scalingRatio.name=Scaling
ForceAtlas25.scalingRatio.desc=How much repulsion you want. More makes a more sparse graph.
ForceAtlas25.gravity.name=Gravity
ForceAtlas25.gravity.desc=Attracts nodes to the center. Prevents islands from drifting away.
ForceAtlas25.strongGravityMode.name=Stronger Gravity
ForceAtlas25.strongGravityMode.desc=A stronger gravity law
ForceAtlas25.distributedAttraction.name=Dissuade Hubs
ForceAtlas25.distributedAttraction.desc=Distributes attraction along outbound edges. Hubs attract less and thus are pushed to the borders.
ForceAtlas25.linLogMode.name=LinLog mode
ForceAtlas25.linLogMode.desc=Switch ForceAtlas' model from lin-lin to lin-log (tribute to Andreas Noack). Makes clusters more tight.
ForceAtlas25.adjustSizes.name=Prevent Overlap
ForceAtlas25.adjustSizes.desc=Use only when spatialized. Should not be used with "Approximate Repulsion"
ForceAtlas25.barnesHutOptimization.name=Approximate Repulsion
ForceAtlas25.barnesHutOptimization.desc=Barnes Hut optimization: n\u00b2 complexity to n.ln(n) ; allows larger graphs.
ForceAtlas25.barnesHutTheta.name=Approximation
ForceAtlas25.barnesHutTheta.desc=Theta of the Barnes Hut optimization.
ForceAtlas25.edgeWeightInfluence.name=Edge Weight Influence
ForceAtlas25.edgeWeightInfluence.desc=How much influence you give to the edges weight. 0 is "no influence" and 1 is "normal".
ForceAtlas25.threads.name=Threads number
ForceAtlas25.threads.desc=More threads means more speed if your cores can handle it.
